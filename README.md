# MyReads
Book List project that sorts books into 3 shelves: Currently Reading, Want To Read, and Read. User can search a list of books and add them to these shelves.

First project for [Udacity React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

## Installation
* Install all dependencies with `yarn install`

## Usage
* To start the application in development mode, use `yarn start`
* To create a production bundle, use `yarn build`.

*Note*: work for this was originally done in https://github.com/joecochran/reactnd-project-myreads-starter but after trying to install eslint, react-scripts stopped working correctly, so I was forced to copy my work into a fresh repo.
